                In 2017 most of my conversations with Pubby were very one sided. I would
                talk and he would listen. But I vaguely remember the first time he ended up
                talking to me. I don’t really remember where we were going, but we were in
                the train together and he started telling me about his friends and college
                life and everything. Honestly I felt a sense of achievement that day and
                pride in the fact that I could connect with Pubby when not many people
                managed it. Of course over time he’s grown and learnt a lot about himself
                and made a whole bunch of friends. But back then I was way too excited
                about the fact that we talked. I actually came back and told my parents and
                my brother and Jasprit this. <br /><br />
                Another significant moment for me with Pubby was when I was in Uttarakhand. I honestly did not consider
                us keeping in touch. I still considered
                him to be Jasprit’s brother and not my friend until one day, he called me -
                just to talk. We talked for a really long time, almost 3 hours. He kept the
                phone saying call me whenever you need me. Thats when I knew that I was
                his friend and that was a very important transition for me.
                I want to thank him for that. Thank him for the fact that even though I’m
                with his brother who he loves very much, he could connect with me and we
                could have our own equation.
                Although we are not the kind who talk to each other everyday, he is one of
                my closest friends. <br /><br />
                There are very few people in my life that I can say will leave everything to
                come and help out. I know he is one of them. And I know he thinks he
                wants to “stand alone and carry others”, but if there ever comes a day when
                standing alone feels a bit difficult, I’ll stand beside him. I know this is a bit
                cheesy, but that’s okay. I don’t really do this everyday :P.<br /><br />
                HAPPY BIRTHDAY PUBBY!!

                Hey weirdo,
                You and I have known each other for a really long time now. We have had our fair share of ups and downs
                but after all that I can very surely say that you are one of the people closest to me(and you know me,
                that’s a real small number). I am so so glad to have met you. You are one person who inspires me a lot
                in every aspect that there is; be it being a better human everyday; to being so inquisitive about
                learning new things; to just being extremely weird(although, I win when it comes to that). We have
                shared so many walks and such random conversations that I can’t actually enlist them all. But those are
                the best type of conversations. If I’d look back at the first year then I couldn’t have imagined you
                being the person you are in my life but that’s the best part about it. I solemnly swear that I’d fulfil
                all the duties of being your Flat Tire throughout time.<br><br>

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution
                of
                letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
                desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
                search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                evolved
                over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
